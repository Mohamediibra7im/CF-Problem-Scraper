# CF-Problem-Scraper

A modular Python project that fetches Codeforces problems based on user-specified tags and rating ranges, and tracks which problems have been solved by a given user.

## Features

- Fetches problems and user submissions via the Codeforces API
- Filters problems by:
  - User-defined tags (e.g., "implementation", "math", "greedy")
  - User-defined rating range (e.g., 800–3500)
  - Option to exclude already solved problems
- Validates user handle, tags, and rating inputs
- Caches API responses to reduce redundant requests and respect rate limits
- Saves results to both JSON and CSV files with unique filenames
- Sorts problems by rating in ascending order
- Modular design with separate files for API handling, input validation, and problem filtering

## Project Structure

```

├── api.py              # Handles Codeforces API interactions
├── input_validation.py # Manages user input and validation

```

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Required libraries:
  - `requests`
  - `requests-cache`
- Install dependencies via:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## Setup

1. Clone or download the project files to a directory.
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install requests requests-cache
   ```
3. Ensure all Python files (`api.py`, `input_validation.py`, `problem_filter.py`, `main.py`) are in the same directory.

## Usage

1. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
2. Follow the prompts to:
   - Enter your Codeforces handle
   - Specify desired tags (comma-separated, e.g., `math,greedy`)
   - Enter minimum and maximum rating (e.g., 800 and 1000)
   - Choose whether to exclude solved problems (y/n)
3. The script will:
   - Validate inputs
   - Fetch and filter problems based on your criteria
   - Save results to uniquely named JSON and CSV files (e.g., `filtered_problems_<uuid>.json`, `filtered_problems_<uuid>.csv`)

## Output

The script generates two files:
- **JSON file**: Contains problem details (name, link, rating, status) in a structured format.
- **CSV file**: Contains the same details in a tabular format, suitable for spreadsheets.

Each problem entry includes:
- **Name**: Contest ID, index, and problem name (e.g., `1000A - Codeforces Rating`)
- **Link**: URL to the problem on Codeforces
- **Rating**: Problem difficulty rating
- **Status**: "solved" or "unsolved" based on the user's submission history

## Configuration

Inputs are provided interactively at runtime. The following are validated:
- **Handle**: Must be a valid Codeforces handle.
- **Tags**: Must be from the list of supported Codeforces tags (see below).
- **Rating Range**: Must be within 800–3500, with minimum ≤ maximum.

To modify default behavior (e.g., default tags or ratings), edit `input_validation.py` or extend the code to read from a configuration file.

## Available Tags

The script supports all standard Codeforces tags, including:
- 2-sat
- binary search
- bitmasks
- brute force
- chinese remainder theorem
- combinatorics
- constructive algorithms
- data structures
- dfs and similar
- divide and conquer
- dp
- dsu
- expression parsing
- fft
- flows
- games
- geometry
- graph matchings
- graphs
- greedy
- hashing
- implementation
- interactive
- math
- matrices
- meet-in-the-middle
- number theory
- probabilities
- schedules
- shortest paths
- sortings
- string suffix structures
- strings
- ternary search
- trees
- two pointers

## Notes

- **API Rate Limits**: The Codeforces API has rate limits (e.g., 1 request per second for some endpoints). The project uses `requests-cache` to cache responses for 1 hour, reducing API calls.
- **Caching**: Cached responses are stored in a local `codeforces_cache.sqlite` file.
- **Error Handling**: The script handles network errors, invalid inputs, and API failures gracefully, with user-friendly error messages.
- **Extensibility**: The modular structure makes it easy to add features like GUI support, progress tracking, or integration with other platforms.

## Example

```bash
$ python main.py
Enter your Codeforces handle: tourist
Enter desired tags (comma-separated, e.g., math,greedy): math,greedy
Enter minimum rating: 800
Enter maximum rating: 1000
Exclude solved problems? (y/n): y
